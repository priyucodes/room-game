You can have a responsive canvas in 3 short and simple steps:

Remove the width and height attributes from your <canvas>.

<canvas id="responsive-canvas"></canvas>
Using CSS, set the width of your canvas to 100%.

#responsive-canvas {
  width: 100%;
}
Using JavaScript, set the height to some ratio of the width.

var canvas = document.getElementById('responsive-canvas');
var heightRatio = 1.5;
canvas.height = canvas.width * heightRatio; -->
